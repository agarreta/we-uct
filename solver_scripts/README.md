This folder contains a python script for each specific solver to be used.
Each script is executed on the terminal by the MCTS_solver algorithm each time it needs to call 'solver'. 
The script then transforms a given equation into a suitable form and then calls the solver on the transformed equation through a terminal command.
Each script is to be placed in the folder from where one would run the soler (default directories are listed below). 
Two reasons for operating like this are: 
1) Not all solvers have a python API but nevertheless are easily callable from the terminal. This allows to use any solver which is currently working on the system.
2) For tose that do, calling the solver directly with our python interpreter produced all sorts of unexpected behaviors.
